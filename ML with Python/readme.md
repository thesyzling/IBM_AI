Machine Learning with Python
This repository folder contains notes, labs, and assignments from the IBM "Machine Learning with Python" course on Coursera. The course introduces fundamental concepts of machine learning using Python, with hands-on examples in Jupyter notebooks.
Course Overview
The course is structured into weekly modules covering key machine learning topics:

Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning - Overview of ML types (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), applications, and basic Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
Week 2: Regression - Simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and evaluation metrics like R-squared and MSE.
Week 3: Classification - Algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), along with confusion matrices and accuracy scoring.
Week 4: Clustering - Unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN).
Week 5: Recommender Systems - Content-based and collaborative filtering methods for building recommendation engines.
Week 6: Final Project - Applying learned concepts to a real-world dataset for prediction and analysis.

Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of Python programming.
Familiarity with data manipulation and visualization.

Installation

Clone the repository:
textgit clone https://github.com/thesyzling/IBM_AI.git

Navigate to the folder:
textcd "ML with Python"

Install required dependencies (use a virtual environment recommended):
